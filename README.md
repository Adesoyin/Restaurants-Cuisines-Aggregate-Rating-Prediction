# Restaurants-Cuisines-Aggregate-Rating-Prediction
This project, "Restaurants' Cuisines Aggregate Rating Prediction," leverages machine learning to predict restaurant ratings based on key features such as: Cuisine types (e.g., Italian, Indian, Chinese), price range, has table booking and delivering online.

**Objectives of the Project**

Analyze Cuisine-Rating Relationships: Identify which cuisines correlate with higher/lower ratings. Explore regional trends.

Feature Engineering: Transform categorical data into model-friendly features. Handle geospatial data (Latitude, Longitude) to infer location-based patterns.

Predictive Modeling: Train regression models (uisng simple linear, Random forest and decision tree regression) to predict aggregate ratings.

Evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE and R²-score.

Give Actionable Insights and provide recommendations for restaurant owners.
